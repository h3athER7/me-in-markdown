# Me In Markdown
## intro
   My name is Heather and I am in 10th grade. I like the color pink and my favorite animal is pandas. I am part of the cheer team at school and I enjoy swimming outside of school. My favorite movie is Spaceballs because I think it is funny and it's been my favorite since I was eight. I also like Miss Peregrine's School for Peculiar Children because I think it's very interesting and I love the concept. For TV shows, my favorite is Stranger Things because I was rewatch it all the time and never get bored. 

 This summer I did a lot of fun activities. I went thrifting with my Tita many times at the goodwill bins. She introduced thrifting to me two years ago, and since then it's been our bonding time. During the summer my family and I went on a week long cruise that went to Mexico. It had three stops at Cabo, Mazatlan, and Puerto Vallarta. On the cruise it was also my birthday, and my dad gifted me airpods. I was really surprised and happy because my old Sony headphones broke a few weeks earlier and it was basically my biggest heartbreak. So now I'm an airpods owner.
 
 For this school year, I obviously am hoping for all A's. I really like getting A's because it makes my mom really proud, and she likes bragging about it to her coworkers. For school I also hope I can be prepared for upcoming seasons for cheer. This year will be the first time I'm in cheer for football season, so I'm just hoping that I don't have massive brainfarts there. For school I'm also hoping I can participate in many clubs. I feel like being in a lot of clubs are stressful, but I might as well go anyway. This year I am also secretary of the PTSA, and I hope I can at least meet expectations there because I've never been secretary of anything and PTSA looks kind of crazy. So overall for school I just hope that I can survive.
